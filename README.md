# Electronic-moving-trace-in-Tokamak
Research the interference caused by the tearing-mode(developed in the magnetohydro dynamic model(MHD)) to the particle orbit in toroidal magnetic field in Tokamak 

This project aims to show how the tearing-mode interfere particle moving orbit.The tearing-mode is test as (1,1) mode and (2,1) mode, developed by MHD model.The simulation also used the Boris algorithm.

## Finished code
- [x] Particle obit in Tokamak,without tearing-mode,base on Boris algorithm.  
- [x] Particle obit centre in Tokamak,with (1,1)/(2,1) tearing-mode,base on ode45.
